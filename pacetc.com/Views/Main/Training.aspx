                <p>It is a well-known fact that English is a native language for over 350 million people around the world. However, the total English-speaking population, including users of English as a second language, is estimated at well over 1 billion. This makes English the most widely used language outside of native-speaking countries, as well as being the official language for a number of major world organisations. Put simply, the ability to speak and do business in English will expand your horizons to all corners of the earth in this age of rapid globalization.</p>
                <p>Pace Training and Consultancy specializes in a number of key areas of language training.</p>

                            <p>A revolutionary new method to unlock students’ speaking capacity. Pace TC has identified 5 key points to help non-native English Speakers open up their speaking ability.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="two-third last">                            
                            <ul class="unordered">
                                <li>Language structure. The position of the verb in an English sentence is the key to formulating the sentence more quickly. Learn the most common verbs and launch your speaking potential.</li>
                                <li>Common words. Approximately 200 words make up 50-80% of all everyday English speech. We have a variety of exercises to quickly learn these words.</li>
                                <li>Chunking. The Turkish language tends to contain a lot of details per sentence, and even per word. A lot of people try to use the same level of detail in English, but they don’t yet know enough grammar or vocabulary. Train your mind to think in more general terms in order to express yourself more easily.</li>
                                <li>Anchors. Many people are nervous about speaking another language, especially with their peers. Learn to overcome this fear and speak more freely and easily.</li>                                
                                <li>Rhythm. The key to sounding more natural in another language. Pace TC makes use of a structure called the Iambic Pentameter, made famous by William Shakespeare, to introduce natural English rhythm to your speech.</li>
