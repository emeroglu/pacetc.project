                <h4>Steve O'Farrell<span>Founder and General Manager</span></h4>
                <p>Steve O’Farrell has been living and working in Turkey for 15 years. Born and educated in Ireland, Steve worked in business, marketing and recruitment in London and Australia, before returning to Ireland to train as a Language Teacher.</p>                
                <p>Since 1998, Steve has been teaching English at schools in Istanbul, with a one-year break to study for a PGCE* in the UK. For most of this time, he has also been doing freelance work as an editor and trainer at corporate level. He is also an accomplished and renowned teacher trainer.</p>
                <p>Steve is a qualified Master Practitioner of NLP** (accredited by IINLP, the Irish Institute of NLP), and incorporates this training extensively into his courses.</p>
                <p>As of 2011, Steve has devoted all of his time and energy into Pace Training and Consultancy, further developing and honing his training courses, as well as developing a revolutionary new method for unlocking people’s capacity to actually speak English. This new method has evolved out of diligent observation of the way Turkish students cope with language learning, especially in contrast with children who are born into a bilingual family, as well as the application of Steve’s experience with NLP and psychology.</p>
                <p>Steve O’Farrell grew up in Ireland, travelled around the world for a while, and then found himself in Istanbul. He is married with 2 young children, Asya (10) and Arda (4). Living in a bilingual household, allied to his teaching and training experience, puts him in a unique position to understand the mechanics of language acquisition.</p>
